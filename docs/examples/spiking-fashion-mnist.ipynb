    "1. Add a temporal dimension to the data/model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spiking models always run over time (i.e., each forward pass through the model will run\n",
    "for some number of timesteps). This means that we need to add a temporal dimension to\n",
    "the data, so instead of having shape `(batch_size, ...)` it will have shape\n",
    "`(batch_size, n_steps, ...)`. For those familiar with working with RNNs, the principles\n",
    "are the same; a spiking neuron accepts temporal data and computes over time, just like\n",
    "an RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Replace any activation functions with `pytorch_spiking.SpikingActivation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pytorch_spiking.SpikingActivation` can encapsulate any activation function, and will\n",
    "produce an equivalent spiking implementation. Neurons will spike at a rate proportional\n",
    "to the output of the base activation function. For example, if the activation function\n",
    "is outputting a value of 10, then the wrapped `SpikingActivation` will output spikes at\n",
    "a rate of 10Hz (i.e., 10 spikes per 1 simulated second, where 1 simulated second is\n",
    "equivalent to some number of timesteps, determined by the `dt` parameter of\n",
    "`SpikingActivation`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pool across time\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of our `pytorch_spiking.SpikingActivation` layer is also a timeseries. For\n",
    "classification, we need to aggregate that temporal information somehow to generate a\n",
